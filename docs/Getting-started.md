# Getting Started
_This content is also available in [the readme](https://github.com/Infocaster/UrlTracker/blob/v8/main/README.md)_

## Requirements
For the URL Tracker to function properly, you need to be connected with a SQL Server database. NOTE: Certain functions are known not to work on SQL Compact Edition and we don't officially support it.  
The URL Tracker should work on Umbraco Cloud.

## Setup
The URL Tracker is available via NuGet. Visit [the URL Tracker on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UrlTracker/) for instructions on how to install the URL Tracker package in your website.
Once installed, build your project and you're ready to make your visitors happy!

_Continue on to learn [how to configure the URL Tracker](./Configuration)._
